## CSS Structure

The theme's CSS is organized into logical sections:

3. **UI Elements** - Styling for buttons, inputs, scrollbars
4. **Obsidian Specific Styling** - Workspace, sidebars, editor, and other Obsidian components

All styles use CSS variables for consistency and to support potential future customization options.
